        <title>LAN Turtle 3G Setup</title>
    </head>
    <body>
<p>Welcome DEF CON hacker :)

<p>You're the first to get your hands on the new LAN Turtle 3G. We're officially launching in August, but everything is ready to go now. Essentially setup is the exact same as with the regular LAN Turtle - so all instructions from <a href="https://lanturtle.com/wiki/#!index.md">the wiki</a> and <a href="https://lanturtle.com/wiki/#!videos.md">the video tutorials</a> apply.

<p>The distinction is that you'll need to insert a Micro SIM card. That's the SIM that's 12 x 15mm -- the one in between the larger Standard size and the smaller Nano size. Typically SIM cards come with the snap-out adapters.

<p>To install the SIM card, open the LAN Turtle 3G carefully. Remove the two screws on the bottom of the unit and with care separate the top and bottom plastics. There is an antenna attached to the top plastic part, so just be gentle as you separate them.

<p>The SIM card slots in on the side of the 3G module with its metal contacts facing the PCB in a top facing orientation.

<p>Then re-assemble the LAN Turtle 3G. Stickers are provided for stealth.

<p>On the software side you'll find the 3G WAN options from the main configuration menu. Typically it's just a matter of setting the APN.

<p>The module will maintain the connection, so there's no other configuration necessary.
